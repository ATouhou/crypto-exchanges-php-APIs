# crypto-exchanges-php-APIs
A bunch of PHP libraries for different crypto currencies' exchanges I've needed to do.
Exchanges supported are: Bitfinex, ... (developing the rest right now).

I've had to implement these APIs in different project I've worked on. I guess I'll use them again in the future and would be great to have them here, with all it's versions and all. 

Feel free to use this code if you find it somewhere and you need it. If you find something wrong, not working well etc... post an Issue or a Pull request. As I don't expect many visitors right now I think I'll be able to handle all them. If not, well... hehe

As they are right now the classes are supposed to be all childs from the parent 'Exchange'.
